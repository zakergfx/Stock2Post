# Stock2Post
This tool allow professionnal cars dealer that are on AutoScout24 https://www.autoscout24.be/ to synchronise their stock with their social networks page (Instagram and Facebook)

The app : https://stock2post.be (now down because of AutoScout24 condition of use)

## The problem

Car dealers have a lot of changes in their stock. They add new cars every day, change prices of cars, sell cars etc. They do this through their AutoScout24 professionnal page.

Most of them are also on social network to promote their activity. However most of them ends with a dead pages since it take too much time to keep their socials active ; they need to reupload all pictures, put the description, making a post when the car is not available anymore, or when there is a discount etc.

So basically everything they are doing on their AutoScout24 stock, they could need to do it for their Facebook and Instagram pages, every day. And it takes a lot of time.

## The solution

One simple solution to this problem is <b>Stock2Post.be</b>. It parse the AutoScout24 stock of registered dealers multiple time a day to detect whether there are new ads, discount and so on to publish on social networks.

The tool allow each dealer to map one Facebook and Instagram page to their account so that the automation can start. They also can configure which type of posts they want for each of their socials (Only new ad post, also post stories, post cars that are in the stock since a logn time and that have not been sold etc.)
